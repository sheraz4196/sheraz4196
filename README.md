## 👋 About

I'm a frontend engineer focused on building **SaaS products** and **developer tools** that solve real problems. I specialize in modern React ecosystems with a strong emphasis on performance, type safety, and scalable UI architecture.

I don't just follow tutorials — I ship products. My work centers on creating **reusable component systems**, optimizing **frontend performance**, and building tools that improve developer workflows.

Currently expanding my backend expertise to become a well-rounded full-stack engineer while maintaining my frontend-first approach.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend Core**
- Next.js, React, TypeScript
- TailwindCSS, CSS3, HTML5
- Zod (runtime validation)

**Backend & Tools**
- Node.js, Express
- MongoDB
- JavaScript (ES6+)

**Focus Areas**
- Component architecture & design systems
- Type-safe development patterns
- Performance optimization
- SaaS product development

---

## 🚀 What I'm Building

- **Production SaaS applications** with Next.js and modern tooling
- **Reusable UI systems** and component libraries
- **Developer tools** that improve workflow efficiency
- Real-world products with user impact, not demo apps

**Current priorities:**
- Advanced frontend architecture patterns
- Full-stack capabilities (backend systems, APIs, databases)
- Performance-first development practices
- Shipping faster, smarter, cleaner

**Charcole** is a powerful CLI tool I built to solve a recurring problem: setting up Node.js backends with proper configuration takes too much time. Charcole generates production-ready Node.js backends in seconds with:

✅ **Perfect Configuration Out of the Box**
- Express.js server with best practices
- Environment variable management (.env)
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Structured folder architecture

✅ **Optional Auth Modules**
- JWT authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- User registration & login endpoints
- Auth middleware ready to use

✅ **Optional Swagger Documentation**
- Auto-generated API documentation
- Interactive API testing interface
- Swagger UI integrated

✅ **Zero Configuration Needed**
- One command to create a complete backend
- No manual setup or config files
- Start coding immediately

**Get Started:**
```bash
npx create-charcole my-backend
```

**Why I Built It:** As a developer building multiple projects, I kept repeating the same backend setup steps. Charcole eliminates that friction, letting developers focus on building features instead of configuration.
