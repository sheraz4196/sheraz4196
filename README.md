**Frontend Engineer** building production-grade React & Next.js applications • Expanding into full-stack systems

## 👋 About

I'm a frontend engineer focused on building **SaaS products** and **developer tools** that solve real problems. I specialize in modern React ecosystems with a strong emphasis on performance, type safety, and scalable UI architecture.

I don't just follow tutorials — I ship products. My work centers on creating **reusable component systems**, optimizing **frontend performance**, and building tools that improve developer workflows.

Currently expanding my backend expertise to become a well-rounded full-stack engineer while maintaining my frontend-first approach.
